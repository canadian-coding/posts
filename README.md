# Posts
This repo is the full collection of posts made on the [@canadiancoding](https://www.instagram.com/canadiancoding/) instagram account. 

It is always a good idea to check out the full repository from my instagram posts because the README's are much more detailed, and provide much more info than I can on instagram.

## Folder Structure
All code is organized by when it was uploaded to instagram. The typical format is ```<year>/<month>/<day> - <topic>```. 

For more details see my instagram page at [@canadiancoding](https://www.instagram.com/canadiancoding/)

## Website
*comming soon, keep an eye on my instagram for more details*
