# Module Showcase; ezspreadsheet

## Description

ezspreadsheet is a python package I wrote a while ago to allow for the easy serialization and deserialization of python objects to/from spreadsheets.

## Definitions

### Serialization

This essentially means to store something generated in a program, in most cases to a file.

### Deserialization

This essentially means to load something from an external source in a program, in most cases a file.

## Usage

### Running

This repo has demo code for testing out storing and loading to/from a spreadsheet. To run the files:

1. Install ezspreadsheet: ```pip install ezspreadsheet``` or ```sudo pip3 install ezspreadsheet```
2. Run the files ```python3 store.py```, ```python3 load.py```

## Real World Applications

There are tons, but for example if you write a script that scrapes data from a site and builds objects, you can then store those values to a spreadsheet and read them later.
