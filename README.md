# Posts
This repo is the full collection of posts made on the [@canadiancoding](https://www.instagram.com/canadiancoding/) instagram account. 

It is always a good idea to check out the full repository from my instagram posts because the README's are much more detailed, and provide much more info than I can on instagram.

## Submitting requests for topics
If you have a topic you would like me to cover please suggest it via contacting me on instagram, or [submit an issue](https://github.com/canadian-coding/posts/issues/new) with the topic idea. 

## Folder Structure
All code is organized by when it was uploaded to instagram. The typical format is ```<year>/<month>/<day> - <topic>```.
